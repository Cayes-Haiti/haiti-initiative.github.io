						<p>The Haiti Initiative (SUD) is a project under the umbrella of the YWCA Cambridge, an NGO based in the United States.The

						<h4 class="font-alt m-t-0 m-b-20">Strategy</h4>
						<p>The Haiti Initiative (SUD) is comprised mostly of members of the Haitian diaspora in the US and in France. Our focus is on outreach to existing non-profits, Haiti-based associations, small companies, and commune / municipal governments. We do this by keeping a database of the folks we are in contact with, organizations doing work on the environment in Haiti, and folks working on environmental education. We put NGOs in contact with others who are working on similar issues or share similar strategies. We arrange meetings between the organizations we work with. To  understand our strategy to working in Haiti, we recommend reading the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti’s article, entitled Cheaper, Better, Longer-Lasting: A Rights- Based Approach to Disaster Response in Haiti. This articulates our concerns regarding NGOs and corporations in Haiti; it reads like a how-to-guide for working in Haiti. The most crucial part of our strategy is that we leverage our resources abroad to support projects in Haiti. Our focus is on environmental issues in Haiti, but this spills over into many aspects of everyday life in Haiti. We are blessed with large networks of wealthy friends and access to funding bodies. We have decided to become the bridge between these resources and folks doing work in Haiti. For each of our projects in Haiti, we work directly with partner organizations in Haiti. As much as possible, we try NOT to be the ones seen as bringing the solution. We work with people already engaged solutions and we work to amplify their voices (sending petitions to the government, publishing articles, circulate calls for supplies). At our conferences  we provide physical spaces for people to share their work and present challenges. We are not the facilitators at these conferences. We are not the educators at the conferences. We are attendees and participants. We are upfront about our concerns, challenges, and limitations.</p>

						<h2 class="module-title font-alt">Mission Statement</h2>
						<p>In October 2016, a massive hurricane flooded the southern peninsula of Haiti further strangling an already economically
							challenged area. Family members called on their relatives abroad for help. Cambridge has and continues to be the home
							a large Haiti community. Many of the residents, including Marie Nirva Tancyl, received one such call. Her panicked
							relatives in Les Cayes and Arniquet needed help quickly, so Nirva wrote a message to the editor of the Cambridge Chronicle.
							The message was published in the newspaper. Cambridge residents flocked to the aid of their Haitian descended community
							members. Cambridge residents donated over $1000 to ship eight barrels of food and supplies to Haiti. The Haiti Initiative
							sprung out of that initial project. Since then, the YWCA Cambridge has become support fiscal pass-through agent for
							all donations. The Haiti Initiative is working directly with local municipal governments in Haiti to provide aid to
							people in rural villages and towns throughout the south. In July 2017, a small delegation of four visited the rural
							villages of Chantal, Port Salut, Torbeck and Arniquet. The people of those villages had asked for support with electricity
							because the electric company had trouble reaching the rural towns after the hurricane. The flooding had made the roads
							and bridges impossible to cross. During the July 2017 visit, the delegation brought funds for the installation of
							the four solar panel posts; as well as computers, printers and other electronic equipment to support local businesses,
							schools and non-profit organizations. In August 2017, the mayor of Arniquet, Maurice Chateau, visited Cambridge. At
							a small gathering at the YWCA Cambridge, he explained the many challenges fiscal and otherwise, of running a rural
							village in the politically and economically poor country of Haiti. He emphasized climate change is the biggest challenge
							facing the people of the village. In February 2018, a small delegation of five went back to Les Cayes and organized
							a conference on climate change organized my deputy Joseph Pierre Serge. The Haiti Initiative was able to raise $1000
							towards the February conference. In addition to attending the conference, the delegation visited Arniquet, Ile la
							Vache, and Torbeck to discuss the local impacts of climate change on the southern region of Haiti with politicians,
							grassroots activists, and NGO workers. Upon our return from the February delegation, the core group of organizers
							have been growing out network in the Boston area. The aim to inform West Indian Americans with knowledge about climate
							change and how it will impact the caribbeans. The larger goal is to prepare responses to mobilize teams with support
							for Haiti-based activists.

					<p class="aboutpar">They say if you're not making someone else's life better you are living yours wrong. This is one of many lessons I have
						learned growing up and still hold with me ‘til this day. I was born in the heart of Port au Prince, Haiti in a working
						class family. My mother was a pediatric nurse and my father a hardworking truck driver. Our home was often a safe haven
						for family members and friends in need. During the mid 90s, Haiti was going through a very tough transition and so
						my parents felt it would be safer to come to America. Still my mothers taught us how to look for resources that we
						needed and to always remember " deux hommes mouye nan lapli gen yonn ki pi mal"... “There are those who are worse off
						than you” I worked very hard to learn English and excelled sports and academics. After graduating from CRLS, I worked
						for the City of Cambridge as a Youth Mentor with the KOED program, as well as the Mayor’s Youth Employment program.
						Currently, I work as an airline representative. It's a job that I truly enjoy; however, I find that I was not doing
						a good job of balancing my life. In January, I became the volunteer US Coordinator for The Haiti Initiative (SUD).
						I am responsible for communicating with our Project Manager; communicating with our US based partners, following up
						with action items from meeting notes, executing events, US based projects, and community needs.</p>
